lmao ok so this is far more surface level than what i was expecting, and as such, imma just do what's expected and intended by this point just to catch up to my skill level. still, though, if anything, it'll be a good thing that i have created at least some sort of project to track my progress, as well as to just motivate myself and really get the ball rolling, since i have nothing to show for any my knowledge on web development thus far...
